Homework questions

--1. What is a window function?
(pg 213) A window function is a function that, for each row, computes a scalar result value based on a calculation
against a subset of the rows from the underlying query.

--2. What does PARTITION do?
(pg 215) PARTITION restricts the window to teh subset of rows that have the same values
in the partitioing columns as in the current row.

--3. What does ORDER BY do?
(pg 215) The window-order clause (ORDER BY) defines ordering (not to be confused with presentation)

--4. What does ROWS BETWEEN do?
(pg 215) A window-frame clause (ROWS BETWEEN <top delimiter> AND <bottom delimiter>) filters a frame,
or a subset, of rows from the window partition between the two specified delimiters.

--5. What is a ranking window function? Why would you use it? Give an example.
(pg 216) You use ranking window functions to rank each row with respect to others in the window. T-SQL
supports four ranking functions: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, and NTILE. The following query
demonstrates the use of these functions

--6. What is an offset window function? Why would you use it? Give an example.
(pg 219/https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/t-sql-programming/introduction-to-t-sql-window-functions/)
 An offset window function is an analytic function that allows you to include values from other rows without doing a self-join. 
You use offset window functions to return an element from a row that is at a certain offset from the
current row or at the beginning or end of a window frame. T-SQL supports two pairs of offset functions:
LAG and LEAD, and FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.

--7. What do LEAD and LAG DO?
(pg 219 and website above) Allow you to pull columns or expressions from a row before (LAG) or after (LEAD) the current row. 

--8. What do FIRST VALUE and LAST VALUE do?
(pg 220) The other two functions allow you to return values from the first row of the partition (FIRST_VALUE) or last row of the partition (LAST_VALUE). FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE also require framing

--9. What is an aggragate window function? Why would you use it? Give an example.
(pg 221) You use aggregate window functions to aggregate the rows in the defined window.

--10. What is a pivot table and what does it do?
(pg 224) Pivoting data involves rotating data from a state of rows to a state of columns, possibly aggregating
values along the way.
