Read chapter 2 of the textbook T-SQL Fundamentals, pages 49 through 73.

1. What is a data type? Why do we have data types?
(pg ) A data type is an attribute that specifies the type of data of any object.
Data types help manage storage space. Let's the computer know what commands are used for data type since all the computer sees is binary code.

2. What is a collation? Name four elements of a collation.
(pg 61) A collation is a property at the database level that will determine default language support, case sensitivity, and sort order for character data in that database.
The four elements include: language support, sort order, case sensitivity, and accent sensitivity

3. How would you strip whitespace from a string? For example, suppose you had \ Dave " but
wanted only \Dave".
(pg 69) To remove the spaces one uses the RTRIM and LTRIM fucntions, which return the input string w/ leading/trailing spaces removed.
Type: SELECT RTRIM(LTRIM ('    abc    '));

4. Suppose you wanted to make a list of every college and university that was called an Institute from
the college table. Write the query.
(pg 72) SELECT name FROM COLLEGES WHERE name LIKE N'[Institute%]';

5. How would you find out the index of the first space in a string? For example, the index of the first
space in \Barack Hussein Obama" would be 7.

(pg 66) By using the CHAR INDEX function. Ex: SELECT CHARINDEX('', 'Barack Hussein Obama');

6. How would you select just the first name in a list of the presidents. Each record looks like the: "George
Washington", "John Adams". First names can be an arbitrary length, from \Cal" to \Benjamin." (e.g.,
Cal College, Benjamin Harrison)

(class) SELECT substr('George Washington', 1,7);

7. What is the order of precedence for the logical operators?

(pg 51 and class) The order of precedence for logical operators is NOT, AND, and BETWEEN,IN,LIKE,OR.

8. What is the order of precedence for the math operators?

(pg 51 and class) The order of precedence for math operators is (* multiplication, / division, % modulo), (+ positive/addition,concatenation - negative/subtraction)

9. What is the difference between a simple and a searched CASE expression?;

(pg 52-53) You use the *simple* form to compare one value or scalar expression with a list of possible values and return a value for the first match.
The *searched* *CASE* form is more flexible in the sense you can specify predicates in the WHEN clauses rather than being restricted to using equality comparisons

10. How would you turn a list of names like this: \LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME", to a list like this:
\FIRSTNAME LASTNAME"?

(class)Select Substring ('Sean Zitzer' instr('Sean Zitzer', ' ') +1 || ',' || substr ('Sean Zitzer', 1, instr ('Sean Zitzer', ' '));

11. How would you turn a list of names like this: \FIRSTNAME LASTNAME", to a list like this: \LAST-
NAME, FIRSTNAME"?

(class) Reversed Select Substring ('Sean Zitzer' instr('Sean Zitzer', ' ') +1 || ',' || substr ('Sean Zitzer', 1, instr ('Sean Zitzer', ' '));

3 Homework Exercises
We will download and install the database the text book uses, TSQLV4. We will do this on the machine
that you installed SQL Server and SSMS on. You will be using this for the homework.
