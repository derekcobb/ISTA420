--1. What is a data type? Why do we have data types?
(pg ) A data type is an attribute that specifies the type of data of any object.
Data types help manage storage space. Let's the computer know what commands are used for data type since all the computer sees is binary code.

--2. What is a collation? Name four elements of a collation.
(pg 61) A collation is a property at the database level that will determine default language support, case sensitivity, and sort order for character data in that database.
The four elements include: language support, sort order, case sensitivity, and accent sensitivity

--3. How would you strip whitespace from a string? For example, suppose you had \ Dave " but
wanted only \Dave".
(pg 69) To remove the spaces one uses the RTRIM and LTRIM fucntions, which return the input string w/ leading/trailing spaces removed.
Type: SELECT RTRIM(LTRIM ('    abc    '));

--4. Suppose you wanted to make a list of every college and university that was called an Institute from
the college table. Write the query.
(pg 72) SELECT name FROM COLLEGES WHERE name LIKE N'[Institute%]';

--5. How would you find out the index of the first space in a string? For example, the index of the first
space in \Barack Hussein Obama" would be 7.

(pg 66) By using the CHAR INDEX function. Ex: SELECT CHARINDEX('', 'Barack Hussein Obama');

--6. How would you select just the first name in a list of the presidents. Each record looks like the: "George
Washington", "John Adams". First names can be an arbitrary length, from \Cal" to \Benjamin." (e.g.,
Cal College, Benjamin Harrison)

(class) SELECT substr('George Washington', 1,7);

--7. Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that calculates
the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to update a column in a database that contains the
date of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.
[pg 85/89] SELECT payment FROM employee.pay WHERE payment = EOMONTH(payment);


--8. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days until
their 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.
[pg 86] By using the DATEDIFF or the DATEDIFF_BIG functions we can make the query like this: SELECT DATEDIFF (day, 'current date', '16th birth date');

--9. What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that maintains a log of events,
such as user logins.
[pg 80] The following niladic (parameterless) functions return the current date and time: GETDATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, GETUTCDATE, SYSDATETIME, SYSUTCDATETIME, SYSDATETIMEOFFSET.
